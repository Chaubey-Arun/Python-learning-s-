Accident touch or hit will through your mobile especially IPhone users need more careful.Using this product just to keep the mobile stand where no one access that place is good usage.For my work style, I do work from home, I frequent take the mobile and new the message and take call. In this style of use, this product is totally worth less because u can accept call when the mobile oils on stand and u can’t text message while on stand. TL you need to take it and do your task which is not much comfortable. Due to slippery while picking the mobile from stand. Better keeping it on desk and taking is the most safest way.Good use of this product, only for watching movies. Not recommended for YouTube videos also."

The stand is nice & sturdy. It's pretty nice to carry around wherever you want and to set it up. The only thing ( and the most important ) is that, the ipad holder came damaged. So, always have to use it in caution."

However the ball and socket joint cannot take the weight of my tablet which is a super slim ms surface pro 7 - just 12.3 inches. The tablet tilts forward and then shakes slightly with air pressure of an overhead fan. Even so, after some adjustments I was able to use it. Let's see what happens after a few months when the ball n socket joint is used for a bit."
